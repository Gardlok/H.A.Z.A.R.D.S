# Architecture

## Principles

1. Local daily-driver use is the primary experience; SSH access reuses the same
   core without requiring a graphical terminal on the remote host.
2. Configuration remains declarative and version controlled.
3. Each kind of state has one authority.
4. Rhai recipes receive registered capabilities rather than an implicit raw
   shell.
5. External applications remain replaceable providers behind Arsenal.
6. Installation is rootless by default and follows XDG paths.

## Runtime shape

On a desktop or laptop, Alacritty starts the HAZARDS control plane and Zellij
workspace. On a remote host, the SSH client's terminal replaces Alacritty.
Helix, Zellij, Arsenal, Rhaisour, and the supporting CLI tools otherwise behave
the same way.

Arsenal is the custom HAZARDS control plane. The foundation implements its
validated pillar/provider registry as a Rust crate. A Ratatui launcher and
system dashboard will build on that registry without moving process execution,
state ownership, or installation logic into UI widgets.

## Profile composition

A concrete profile is the product of three dimensions:

| Dimension | Values | Controls |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Host | desktop, laptop, remote | Graphics and host capabilities |
| Persistence | local, roaming, ghost | State lifetime and synchronization |
| Role | development, operations, research | Supporting provider selection |

Ghost mode excludes Atuin and persistent SurrealDB storage. A future Surrelish
adapter will use an in-memory engine for Ghost mode.

## Trust boundaries

- Recipe text is untrusted until compiled and approved.
- Rhaisour disables dynamic `eval` and imports and enforces operation/depth
  limits.
- Future process capabilities accept an executable plus argument vector rather
  than shell text.
- Dotfiles never contain secrets.
- SurrealDB never becomes a credential vault.
- Remote Zellij control remains bound to the authenticated host session.
